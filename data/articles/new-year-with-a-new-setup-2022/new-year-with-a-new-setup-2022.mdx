# 1. Introduction

Covid appeared in 2019 and with this pandemic companies and employees had to adapt to the new reality of working remotely. Of course, for people that work in IT, remote work was already a thing before this pandemic. Besides the fact that the company that I work for already had remote-friendly policies and some of us were already used to work from home, I never had the opportunity or need to have a working setup at home.
For me, having a place where I'm comfortable during work hours it's a game-changer as it improves my productivity a lot. I decided to share everything that I have on my setup so you guys can take a look and maybe some ideas for your own setups.

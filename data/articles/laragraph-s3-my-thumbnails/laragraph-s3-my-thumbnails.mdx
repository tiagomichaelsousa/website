# Introduction

I don't know about you, but for me uploading files is always the trickiest and funniest part when building a product.
How should I save the file? How should I validate the file? Where should I save the file?
The feedback that I got from the poll that I created on twitter shows that most of you probably feel the same way as I do so let's have a look into this topic!

Before cloud native was a thing, the files were being saved in the same place where the code for the application 
was deployed, normally in a VPS (Virtual Private Server). As you can imagine this may bring about some problems... 
What if your VPS dies? You lose all the images? Having this example in mind and many others that software engineers were facing
a solution called S3 came into the market.
S3 stands for **Simple Storage Service** and it's basically an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
You know... all those things that cloud native services and applications offer!

Nowadays, almost every single cloud provider has a S3 service like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs) or even
[Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

This solution really changed the way that engineers develop their applications and with so much traction some on perm solutions like [MinIO](https://min.io/) appeared.

## MinIO
MinIO is the perfect solution for your development environment as you can simply define it in your docker-compose and use it out of the box, instead of subscribing and paying for object storage
for your team's development environment.
If you want to manage your own S3 service you can deploy MinIO in multipe ways and host it in your cloud native environment, independently of the cloud provider you are using. 
But today we are not talking about cloud in depth, so let's focus on our problem and start configuring MinIO for our development environment.

[Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail) already comes with support for MinIO, which is great! It will take a little bit of boilerplate and configuration from our side.
To install MinIO let's just re-run the install command and select both MySQL and MinIO by typing `0,6` after running the following command:
```
sail artisan sail:install
```

> If you have php installed on your machine you can also use `php artisan sail:install`

![Sail install command](./sail-install.png)

> You need to have your containers running before running the `sail:install` command. For that run `sail up -d`.

After this, your `docker-compose` file should be updated and MinIO included and configured! Before checking if everything is working with our development environment we still need to update our `.env` file 
to tell laravel to use s3 as our drive for the file system:

```bash filename=.env
FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3
```

We also need to update our environment variables regaring S3 configuration

```bash filename=.env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=sail
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=laragraph
AWS_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true
```

> Laravel uses `AWS_*` environment variables to configure the file system but it will work for every cloud provider, you just need to put the correct values.

Now that we have everything installed and configured let's check if everything is okay by starting our docker development environment:

```
sail up -d
```

If we did everything correctly, our MinIO should be available at [http://localhost:8900/](http://localhost:8900/)
![MinIO Login Screen](./minio-login-screen.png)

> The username and password should be the values defined for the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

When we changed our application environment variables we added `AWS_BUCKET=laragraph`, but when starting the MinIO container it doesn't come with any default bucket...
For that we can create a docker container that will use [MinIO client](https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/reference/minio-mc.html) (which is called `mc`) 
in order to create a default bucket for us called `laragraph` as we previously configured in our `.env`.

```yaml filename=docker-compose.yaml
minio-buckets:
  image: minio/mc:latest
  environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: '${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}'
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: '${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
      AWS_ENDPOINT: '${AWS_ENDPOINT}'
  depends_on:
      - minio
  networks:
      - sail
  entrypoint: >
      /bin/sh -c "
      /usr/bin/mc alias set laragraph $AWS_ENDPOINT $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY;
      /usr/bin/mc mb laragraph/laragraph;
      /usr/bin/mc policy set download laragraph/laragraph;
      "
```

Let's run our development environment again in order to start the container that will create the default bucket for laragraph.

```
sail up -d
```
If you refresh your MinIO you should now have a default bucket called `laragraph` 😎

![MinIO Laragraph Bucket](./minio-laragraph-bucket.png)

# Testing the upload

At this point everything should be configured, so let's see if we can get images uploaded to MinIO from our laravel application.
I often define a `/foo` route in my `web.php` file to test these kind of things!
For this test let's just try to drag a random image to your bucket and access it with laravel `Storage` facade. 
If we are able to, then we are sure that everything is working as intended!

```php filename=routes/web.php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

Route::get('/foo', function () {
    return Storage::allFiles();
});
```

Now if you access the `/foo` endpoint you should see an array of images that you dragged into our laragraph bucket, right?
Well, theoretically yes, but unfortunately no ... At this point we are presented with an error saying:

```md copy=false dots=false 
Class "League\Flysystem\AwsS3V3\PortableVisibilityConverter" not found
```

Which basically means that we are missing a dependency so let's fix that!

```
sail composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

Now, let's try again and refresh the `/foo` endpoint 👀 
Yeahh, now we're talking! An array of images from our MinOI instance! 🥳
With this we are certain that everything is well configured and we are ready to write some code 🔥 (I know that you were waiting for this 😉)

# Take me to the clouds

Lighthouse facilitates the upload of files by providing a scalar for it as you can see [here](https://lighthouse-php.com/5/digging-deeper/file-uploads.html#setup).

In order to enable this scalar, we have to define it in our schema. I like to have all scalars defined at the beginning of the file, but you can add them anywhere.

```graphql filename=graphql/schema.graphql
"Can be used as an argument to upload files using https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec"
scalar Upload @scalar(class: "Nuwave\\Lighthouse\\Schema\\Types\\Scalars\\Upload")
```

After adding the scalar, we need to use it! In our `Article` type let's add a new field: The `thumbnail`

```diff filename=graphql/articles.graphql
type Article {
    "Unique primary key."
    id: ID!

    "Unique slug address."
    slug: String!

    "Non-unique title."
    title: String!

    "Non-unique body."
    body: String!

+      "Thumbnail path"
+      thumbnail: String

    "The guardor of the article"
    user: User! @belongsTo

    "When the article was created."
    created_at: DateTime!

    "When the article was last updated."
    updated_at: DateTime!
}
```

Well, it looks like we have a new field! So we need to:
- update our `CreateArticleInputValidator` in the schema
- update our migrations
- update our models
- update our validators
- update our logic to upload the thumbnail

Starting with the schema let's add the scalar that we previously defined

```graphql filename=graphql/articles.graphql line=5
input CreateArticleInput @validator {
    slug: String!
    title: String!
    body: String!
    thumbnail: Upload
}
```

Now let's add the `thumbnail` field as a nullable field.

```php filename=database/migrations/create_articles_table.php line=8
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('slug')->unique();
        $table->string('title');
        $table->text('body');
        $table->string('thumbnail')->nullable();
        $table->timestamps();

        $table->foreignIdFor(User::class)
            ->constrained()
            ->cascadeOnDelete()
            ->cascadeOnUpdate();
    });
}
```

The third step is to update our model and add the thumbnail as a fillable field.

```php filename=app/Models/Article.php line=5
protected $fillable = [
    'title',
    'body',
    'slug',
    'thumbnail',
];
```

Now let's validate our thumbnail. But first let's create a use case just for the sake of this demo project! 

**Sometimes** our user will upload a thumbnail but when he doesn't we want to return a default thumbnail for him! That's why we added the `thumbnail` field as `nullable`
Regarding validation it's pretty straight forward! **Sometimes** we want to validate the **image**, **sometimes** we don't! Let's see how can we do this in our validation class

```php filename=app/GraphQL/Validators/CreateArticleInputValidator.php line=7
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'slug' => ['required', Rule::unique('articles', 'slug')],
        'title' => ['required'],
        'body' => ['required'],
        'thumbnail' => ['sometimes', 'image'],
    ];
}
```

> The `image` validation comes from laravel and it will ensure that the image has a jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, gif, svg, or webp extension.
If you want to have a deeper look into the validation rules feel free to check them [here](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/validation#available-validation-rules).

To be honest, this can't get more easy, right? Right? .... Well how can we return a default value when the `thumbnail` is null? 
Laravel has something called [Accessors & Mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators) which are ways of manipulating values when they are accessed or set.
What we want to do here is to set a default value when the `thumbnail` is null and for that let's define an `Accessors` in our `Article` model.

```php filename=app/Models/Article.php
/**
 * The URL for the default thumbnail.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public const DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL_PATH = 'https://placeimg.com/640/380/tech';

/**
 * Interact with the article thumbnail
 *
 * @param  string  $value
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute
 */
protected function thumbnail(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
        get: fn ($value) => $value ? Storage::url($value) : self::DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL_PATH
    );
}
```

At this point, the only missing step is to change the logic for the `store` method in the `ArticleMutation` to allow file uploads!

```php filename=app/GraphQL/Mutations/ArticleMutation.php
/**
 * @param  null  $_
 * @param  array<string, mixed>  $request
 */
public function store($_, array $request)
{
    $user = request()->user();

    /** @var \Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile $file */
    $file = Arr::has($request, 'thumbnail') ? Storage::putFile("{$user->id}/blog", $request['thumbnail']) : null;

    return $user->articles()->create([
        ...$request, 
        'thumbnail' => $file
    ]);
}
```

You may be thinking that this isn't the correct way to do things and you are right... 
There are a lot of things that we should ensure here. For example we should only create the article if the image is successfully uploaded or, 
if the image is uploaded but the article failed it's creation, we should remove the image. 
I could cover all these topics, but the article would be too extensive so I will let that part open for you to try and implement as well 😉

> When you are building your product be sure to always have this in mind!

# Let me try! 🥹
Now that we have everything we need implemented for our feature let's try it out! 
Unfortunately, the graphql playground that we have out of the box available at [http://localhost/graphql-playground](http://localhost/graphql-playground) doesn't provide a way to upload files so we will have to switch to something like
[postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) in order to upload a file or use a `curl` request.

#### cURL me!
In order to understand that both the creation for our articles work with and without the file upload let's make two requests

- without file upload

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost/graphql' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer o1jgkgpywh5Xwt6bUMMXYNvCy3zDGBGFFuj8w8qG' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"query":"mutation {createArticle(input: {slug: \"article-without-thumbnail\" title: \"Article without thumbnail\" body: \"My awesome content 😎\"}) { title slug thumbnail }}"}'
```

If everything is working as expected for this request we should expect the thumbnail to come with the default thumbnail path that we previously defined and guess what 👀

```json
{
   "data":{
      "createArticle":{
         "title":"Article without thumbnail",
         "slug":"article-without-thumbnail",
         "thumbnail":"https://placeimg.com/640/380/tech"
      }
   }
}
```

- with file upload

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost/graphql' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer o1jgkgpywh5Xwt6bUMMXYNvCy3zDGBGFFuj8w8qG' \
--form 'operations="{ \"query\": \"mutation CreateArticle($file: Upload!) {createArticle(input: {slug: \\\"article-with-thumbnail\\\" title: \\\"Article with thumbnail\\\" body: \\\"My awesome content 😎\\\" thumbnail: $file}) {title slug thumbnail}}\" }"' \
--form 'map="{ \"0\": [\"variables.file\"] }"' \
--form '0=@"/Users/tsousa/Desktop/random-image.png"'
```
> Don't forget to change the last `--form` value to a valid image path from your machine.

Now if everything is working as expected (which i'm pretty sure it is 😎) the output should be the url for our image!

```json
{
   "data":{
      "createArticle":{
         "title":"Article with thumbnail",
         "slug":"article-with-thumbnail",
         "thumbnail":"http://minio:9000/laragraph/1/blog/elnoEFL0qCgtaRzhkTXCgMKBAIrJIpIknbqMfYuA.jpg"
      }
   }
}
```

#### POST me MAN

As I said, we can also use postman to test this out 😎
When configuring the request, don't forget to add your access token in the `Authorization` tab, to define the request as a `POST` and the mapping for the file to be type of `file`.

In order to be easier for you I will add the configuration for the `operations` and `map` values below

**Operations**
```json dots=false
{ "query": "mutation CreateArticle($file: Upload!) {createArticle(input: {slug: \"article-with-thumbnail-from-postman\" title: \"Article with thumbnail from postman\" body: \"My awesome content 😎\" thumbnail: $file}) {title slug thumbnail}}" }
```

**Variables**
```json dots=false
{ "0": ["variables.file"] }
```

![Postman file upload](postman-file-upload.png)

# Don't you dare fail! 😡

As part of this series I also want to cover testing as I think thats a very important topic and isn't as much time consuming as people think.
Let's start by rename the `can create an article` test to `can create an article without thumbnail` as the logic changed a little bit.
Laravel offers a really nice `fake()` method as part as the `Storage` facade that will allow you to easily generate a fake disk that simplifies the testing of file uploads.
This method from the `Storage` facade combined with `fake()` method from the `UploadedFile` will make you feel like you are cheating when you are writing tests for file uploads.
The `fake()` method from the `UploadedFile` will return a File instance that you can use to simulate a real file for testing purposes.

Now that the basics are explained let's replace some code, shall we?

```diff filename=tests/Feature/ArticleTest.php
-  it('can create an article', function () {
+  it('can create an article without thumbnail', function () {
    Sanctum::actingAs(User::factory()->create());
    $article = Article::factory()->make();

    $this->assertDatabaseCount('articles', 0);

    $this->graphQL('
        mutation ($slug: String!, $title: String!, $body: String!) {
            createArticle(input: { slug: $slug, title: $title, body: $body }) {
                title
                slug
+                  thumbnail
            }
        }',
        [
            'slug' => $article->slug,
            'title' => $article->title,
            'body' => $article->body,
        ]
    )->assertJson([
        'data' => [
            'createArticle' => [
                'title' => $article->title,
                'slug' => $article->slug,
+                  'thumbnail' => Article::DEFAULT_THUMBNAIL_PATH
            ],
        ],
    ]);

    $this->assertDatabaseHas('articles', [
        'title' => $article->title,
    ]);
});
```

We already ensured that creating an article without a thumbnail will work and a default value will be returned for it.
Now we have to ensure that, when creating a new article with a thumbnail, it also works!

```php filename=tests/Feature/ArticleTest.php
it('can create an article', function () {
    Storage::fake('s3');
    Sanctum::actingAs(User::factory()->create());
    $article = Article::factory()->make();

    $this->assertDatabaseCount('articles', 0);

    $operations = [
        'query' => /** @lang GraphQL */ '
            mutation ($slug: String!, $title: String!, $body: String!, $thumbnail: Upload) {
                createArticle(input: { slug: $slug, title: $title, body: $body, thumbnail: $thumbnail }) {
                    title
                    slug
                    thumbnail
                }
            }
        ',
        'variables' => [
            'slug' => $article->slug,
            'title' => $article->title,
            'body' => $article->body,
            'thumbnail' => null,
        ],
    ];

    $map = [
        '0' => ['variables.thumbnail'],
    ];

    $file = UploadedFile::fake()->image('avatar.jpg');

    $response = $this->multipartGraphQL($operations, $map, [
        '0' => $file,
    ])->assertJson([
        'data' => [
            'createArticle' => [
                'title' => $article->title,
                'slug' => $article->slug,
            ],
        ],
    ]);

    Storage::assertExists(Str::remove('/storage/',  $response['data']['createArticle']['thumbnail']));

    $this->assertDatabaseHas('articles', [
        'title' => $article->title,
    ]);
});
```

To run our suite now just use sail and your tests should pass! 😎

```
sail test
